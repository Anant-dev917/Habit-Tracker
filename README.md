A Habit Tracker web app made using flask and python. It helps the users keep track of any habit on a day to day basis, by allowing them to mark them as "finished". Users can also view habits at past dates and their completion status. 

This project was made as part of the Full Stack web developer course by Jose Salvatierra on Udemy, and was an excellent means of strengthening my grasp on Flask and Python.
